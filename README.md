# universal-checker

*UniversalChecker: an application that enables the configuration of a collection of command-line tools and executes those tools against a collection of files via a graphic UI for Windows*

> **Year Implemented: 2004**
>
> UniversalChecker was inspired by my interest in learning how to develop full-fledged Windows client applications (C++ using MFC in this case) and motivated by a desire to make a collection of internally developed command-line tools with different conventions easier to work with collectively.

## Integrating Command-Line Tools

A simple static-code-analysis command-line tool implementation that can be used to experiment with UniversalChecker can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/shelterbelt/instance-of-cross-reference).
